# This is a script to create a [parchive][1] of given file(s)/folder(s).
# On input, it will tar the files, run `par2` on them to create a parchive,
# tar all output files together, then encrypt the output.
#
# This requires [par2][1] to already be installed and callable
# with that name.
#
# Script should be called like the following:
# ```
# par-crypt <password> <output-filename> <input-files...>
# ```
